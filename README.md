  ## 1. Instructions
  The application requires VS Code and at least Node 18.20.4, Node Package Manager 10.7.0, the Inquirer package 8.2.4, and Jest 29.7.0.

  </br>
 In the VS Code terminal, you will just need to enter 'node index.js' and press enter. Doing so will let the application begin prompting the user for inputs.

  When the application prompts, you will need to enter the Logo Text (limited to 3 characters), the desired shape, and the color of the text and shape (can be hexidecimal color or general color name). Once all prompts are filled and submitted, the generated image will be saved under the Output folder.</br>
